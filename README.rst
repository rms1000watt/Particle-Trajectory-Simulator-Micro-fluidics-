ptspy: Particle Trajectory Simulator for Python
==============

Introduction
============

This project simulates trajectories of micro-scale particles flowing through fluid and electric fields. The simulator was intended to study Stoke's and Dielectrophoresis forces acting on particles traversing microfluidic, biomedical devices. For instance, particles are separated based on their dielectric properties which would allow us to isolate cancer cells in the blood. 

This project was used during the design process of a microfluidic device to significantly cut down on manufacturing time. This simulator allowed us to say, "..this design is best, go manufacture it..." rather than saying, "..manufacture these 15 designs and lets see what's best.."

An example code was used

Requirements
============

Python 2.7 (Haven't tested with other Python 2.X, but I assume it should be fine. However, most likely not compatible with Python 3.X.)

Python Libraries:
	numpy
	matplotlib
	pylab
	math
	json
	argparse

Notes
=====

Vector fields must first be generated for this simulator to work. COMSOL was used to generate and export vector fields in .csv format.

Requires Vector Fields for force calculations. Vector fields for ptspy were generated by COMSOL. Configuration is as follows: ...yadda...
